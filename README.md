# üé∂ QualityQueue

**Elevate your playlists with intelligent merging and high-quality audio analysis.**

---

## üõ† Features

- **Audio-Based Comparison**: Analyzes the actual audio content rather than relying solely on metadata.
- **Intelligent Merging**: Prioritizes high-fidelity tracks when merging multiple playlists.
- **Advanced Fingerprinting**:
  - Uses **Dynamic Range**, **Spectral Rolloff**, **Spectral Centroid**, and **Spectral Bandwidth** to create a rich audio fingerprint.
  - Applies a **weighted scoring system** to determine track quality.
- **JSON Caching & Storage**: Caches previously computed fingerprints in `~/.qualityqueue`, minimizing redundant processing and allowing for quick subsequent runs.
- **Graceful Handling**:
  - Safe cancellation with `Ctrl-C`.
  - Detailed logging and error handling to skip problematic files without halting the entire process.

## üöÄ Why QualityQueue?

When you download playlists from platforms like SoundCloud or Tidal, it's easy to end up with mismatched versions, remixes, and low-quality duplicates. **QualityQueue** helps you tidy your local playlists, ensuring that only the best-quality tracks make the cut.

By analyzing the actual audio content and maintaining a cache for previously processed tracks, QualityQueue is both **accurate** and **efficient**, helping you manage your local music library with ease.

---

## üéß Ideal For

- **Audiophiles & DJs** who need consistent high-quality audio across their sets.
- **Music Enthusiasts** aiming to maintain a pristine local library without duplicate or low-quality tracks.
- **Anyone** who manages large, downloaded playlists and values fidelity and organization.

## üõë Prerequisites

1. **Conda Installation**:  
   Install **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** if you haven't already.
   - [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (lightweight)
   - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (full-fledged data science environment)

2. **Create and Activate Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create --name qualityqueue python=3.12
   conda activate qualityqueue
   ```

## üîß Installation

### 1. Core Dependencies
Install core Python libraries with Conda:
```bash
conda install numpy librosa
```

*(Optional)* If you plan to potentially add GPU or other audio features in the future, you can explore additional packages like `soundfile` via:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge soundfile
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/qualityqueue.git
cd qualityqueue
```

### 3. Install QualityQueue
Install QualityQueue into your Conda environment:
```bash
pip install .
```

## üí° Usage

**Basic Comparison** (no changes made, just analysis and caching):
```bash
qualityqueue /path/to/source /path/to/target -v
```

**Merging Playlists** (prioritize higher-quality tracks from source to target):
```bash
qualityqueue /path/to/source /path/to/target -v --merge
```

**Customize JSON Location** (if you don't want to use `~/.qualityqueue`):
```bash
qualityqueue /path/to/source /path/to/target -v --merge --json /path/to/custom.json
```

### Additional Flags
- `-v` for verbose output (detailed logging).
- `-w` to specify the number of worker processes for parallel processing:
  ```bash
  qualityqueue /source /target -v -w 8
  ```
  This can speed up analysis on multi-core machines.
